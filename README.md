# Git Hooks

Git Hooks are scripts that run automatically when certain events happen in a Git repository. You can use them to automate tasks like running linters, running unit tests, or triggering a code review process.

For more information about Git Hooks, see the Git Hooks: git-hooks.md documentation.
